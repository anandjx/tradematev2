## Institutional AI for Global Equity Intelligence & Forecast Calibration

---

## 🔹 Short Description

TradeMate is a multi-agent institutional AI system for global stock, ETF, and commodity analysis across 20+ major exchanges — combining narrative intelligence, technical modeling, and probabilistic forecasting into structured decision frameworks.

---

## 🔹 Full Description

**TradeMate** is an enterprise-grade, multi-agent AI system built for institutional-level stock understanding and market analysis.

Powered by a transformer-based forecasting engine (TimesFM 2.5, trained on 400B+ time-series data points), TradeMate performs structured inference across:

* 20+ major global stock exchanges
* Large-cap and mid-cap equities
* Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
* Liquid commodities

TradeMate integrates narrative signals, technical regime analysis, and probabilistic forecasting into disciplined strategic frameworks designed for professional investors.

This is not a retail signal generator.
It is a **decision calibration engine** designed to assist institutional workflows.

All outputs follow strict data integrity rules — no fabricated financial metrics, no invented assumptions, and no unsupported projections.

# 🌍 Global Market Coverage

TradeMate supports inference across major exchanges including:

* North America
* Europe
* Asia-Pacific
* Select emerging markets

It can analyze:

* Single-name equities
* Sector and thematic ETFs

# 🔍 Core Capabilities

## 1️⃣ Multi-Agent Institutional Research Architecture

TradeMate operates through a structured workflow:

### • Market Intelligence Agent

Extracts and synthesizes:

* Regulatory filings (where available)
* Earnings disclosures
* Insider activity (if disclosed)
* News and narrative shifts
* Peer positioning commentary

### • Technical Regime Agent

Evaluates:

* Trend structure
* RSI and momentum regimes
* Support/resistance levels
* Volatility states
* Price compression or expansion conditions

### • Forecast Engine (TimesFM 2.5 Transformer)

Provides:

* Probabilistic directional pathways
* Drift and skew identification
* Forecast asymmetry detection
* Regime-sensitive inference

Forecasts are treated as probabilistic scenarios — not deterministic predictions.

### • Quantitative Synthesis Agent

Calibrates:

* Cross-signal alignment
* Confidence scoring (0–100)
* Risk/Reward mapping
* Structural vs tactical state
* Signal divergence analysis

### • Strategic Blueprint Agent

Translates synthesis into:

* Conditional execution zones
* Scenario mapping (Bull/Bear pathways)
* Exposure calibration logic
* Framework stability assessment
* Risk expression mapping

Each agent operates under strict downstream data constraints to minimize hallucination risk.

# 🧠 Institutional-Grade Reasoning Logic

TradeMate applies structured reasoning inspired by institutional analyst workflows, including:

* Narrative–Price tension analysis
* Earnings reaction calibration
* Capital structure constraint evaluation
* Signal convergence scoring
* Volatility gate interpretation around catalysts

These logic layers are rule-based and dependent strictly on upstream data availability.

No implicit valuation modeling is introduced unless explicitly provided by source inputs.

---

# 📊 Output Experience

TradeMate produces:

* Structured institutional research briefs
* Quantified signal convergence summaries
* Scenario probability mapping
* Exposure logic frameworks
* Risk invalidation thresholds

All outputs are delivered through a modern, state-of-the-art web interface designed for clarity and professional readability.

Each analysis generates a **downloadable HTML institutional report**, allowing:

* Internal research distribution
* Committee-ready documentation
* Archiving for compliance workflows

The HTML format preserves structured sections, tables, and conditional frameworks.

---

# 🔐 Data Governance & Integrity

TradeMate enforces:

* No invented financial figures
* No fabricated insider activity
* No unsourced valuation metrics
* Explicit omission of unavailable data
* Strict asset-lock verification to prevent cross-asset contamination

If required inputs are missing, sections are clearly labeled as unavailable.

This design supports enterprise compliance environments.
